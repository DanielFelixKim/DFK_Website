# DFK_Website

See it here: https://danielfelixkim.github.io/DFK_Website/

My personal website to share my music and engineering work! I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Velocity.js and jQuery. I enjoy these types of projects because it always feels like there's something else to fix or improve on! See below for the more information and current status. 

## Tech Used

Even before I started this project, I wanted to create the animation for my name seen in the landing page. Despite not knowing anything about Adobe Illustrator or SVG animation when I started, I managed to create something I'm proud of as a first draft! I recommend reading the Velocity.js documentation if you are looking to pick it up!

## Known Issues

I consider this website to still be in beta, since there's things like the mobile experience and formatting issues that need to be ironed out. Be sure to check back frequently for fixes and updates.

## Future Goals

I had a lot of fun building the website, and went through a couple design iterations before settling on this one. But I would love to add more SVG animations as well as some transitions between sections.
